# OOPs-Banking-

The Banking System is a simulated application that allows users to manage their bank accounts through a command-line interface. It offers essential banking functionalities such as account creation, secure login, and various operations including deposits, withdrawals, and balance inquiries. Designed for simplicity and user-friendliness, this system serves as an educational tool to understand the fundamentals of banking operations and the basic principles of software design.

## Description:
This Banking System is structured around two primary classes: BankAccount and BankingSystem.

### BankAccount Class:
This class represents individual bank accounts. Each account is initialized with a username, password, and a starting balance of zero. The class provides methods for users to deposit and withdraw funds while enforcing rules such as ensuring deposits and withdrawals are valid and that withdrawals do not exceed the available balance. It also allows users to check their current balance.

### BankingSystem Class:
This class manages user interactions and multiple accounts. It features a menu-driven interface that guides users through creating accounts or logging in. Upon successful login, users can perform banking operations such as depositing money, withdrawing cash, or checking their balance. The program continuously prompts for options until the user chooses to log out or exit.

Overall, the Banking System showcases a foundational approach to building interactive software. It emphasizes user input validation and the flow of control in an application, making it a suitable project for beginners looking to learn about programming concepts and basic systems design. In the future, enhancements such as password security, data persistence, and a graphical user interface could significantly improve its functionality and usability.
